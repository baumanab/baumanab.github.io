## My Jekyll Blog

This blog, hosted on github pages, was built starting with a fork from [Skinny Bones](http://mmistakes.github.io/skinny-bones-jekyll/).  The intent of the blog is to share my adventures in learning and applying data science.  Comments, critiques, code suggestion, etc. are welcome and encouraged.
