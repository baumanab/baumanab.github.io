# Seattle Crime!

I recently attended my first [Open Seattle](http://openseattle.org/), hosted at [Socrata](https://www.socrata.com). There were a lot of great people there and interesting projects. While my main interests lie in health data and transportation data, one of the projects introduced that night was to help people in NW Seattle understand local crime data. This sounded like a lot of fun, plus Socrata and the [Open Data Network](http://www.opendatanetwork.com/) are like "data crack" to me, so really any excuse to analyze data is good enough for me. This is also a project close to home, since I live in one of the neighborhoods of interest.  After the meeting I signed up for [Next Door](https://nextdoor.com/city/seattle--wa/) and started trying to figure out an approach. Here is my strategy, most definitely a work in progress.  Hopefully a variety of people will be involved in the project who can bring their own ideas and perspectives to enrich or redirect the strategy below.

## The Strategy

- **Define the customer and what they want:**
    + **The customer:**  The customer is a resident of the NW Seattle neighborhoods, specifically Greenlake, Greenwood, Phinney, Broadview, and Bitterlake. This includes me.
    + **What do they want?**Ultimately people want less/no crime. Practically speaking I think people would like to be empowered and not feel helpless against crimes, ranging from petty package thefts and vandalism all they way up to violent crimes. For example, if people were to understand what crimes are occuring that are community preventable vs. what crimes are occuring the require police assistance, this could be helpful. From reading Next Door threads it sounds like people would really like to increase police resources in this area. One suggested way to do this was to report all crimes or to track unreported crimes. Maybe we could develop a tool for this or present one that already exists. 
    

- **Determine goals. Potential goals include:**  
    + Inform NW Seattle residents about available crime data resources and help them understand the data
    + Use the data to empower NW Seattle residents and enable action, such as more effective crime prevention or re-allocation of city resources.
    + Develop a persistent resource (e.g. a website or app) which will help continue and reinforce empowerment
    
    
- **Determine tactical approach to achieve goals:**
  + How can we best present the data and resources (visualization types etc.)?
  + What is the best way to present the data (pub night, local library, website, musical, morse code)?
  
  
- **Determine resources and methods:** I try never to reinvent the wheel. One hour in the library can save you a week in the lab.
  + What data resources are available?
  + What analyses have other people done on Seattle Crime data?
  + What analyses have other people done on crime data in other cities that we can apply?
  + What tools are currently available?
